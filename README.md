# Election-Analysis

## Overview and Purpose of the Election Audit:

The purpose of this project for us was to find the winning county based on the largest number of votes. We also learned how to read .csv files using Python and how to write the output into a .txt file. We did some calculations for finding the winning candidate and winning county. We also figured out how many votes each candidate and county recieved. We calculated the percentage of total votes each candidate and county recieved.

## Election-Audit Results:

### Overall Summary:
* There were 369,711 votes cast in the congressional election

### County Votes Breakdown:
* Out of the total votes:
  - 38,855 (10.5%) votes were from Jefferson County
  - 306,055 (82.8%) votes were from Denver County
  - 24,801 (6.7%) votes were from Arapahoe County
* As shown by the county votes breakdown above, Denver county had the largest number of votes

### Candidate Votes Breakdown:
* Out of the total votes:
  - 85,213 (23.0%) votes were for Charles Casper Stockham
  - 272,892 (73.8%) votes were for Diana DeGette
  - 11,606 (3.1%) votes were for Raymon Anthony Doane
* As shown by the candidate votes breakdown above, Diana DeGette recieved the largest amount of votes, acquiring 272,892 (73.8%) votes.

## Election-Audit Summary:

I would like to request the election commission commitee to take a look at this program and see the results. Here we can use the same code with just a few minor modifications to analyse the results of any election, in many other ways and get more insight about the voting patterns of the counties.
  For example, we can see and check what percentage of the total population came forward to vote - we can also gather data acording to the age groups of the voters, 
  their race and ethnicity, which can give us more information about our citizens and we can find out where the trend is going with younger generations.
  1. Here we have data for individual candidates and counties- we can seperate the data in the same way for voters' age group and race, which gives us the information like which   age group thinks in which direction as per their support to a specific party and party's agenda.
  2. We can also check how many votes turn-up for voting just by comparing it to the total numbers of eligible voters, and that gives us a clear idea of how many votes were 
  casted in each county. Where there are more votes casted, we get a more detailed idea about what our citizens want and what they think about the future of our county.
  4. We can give a presentation on how and why we can maximize the use of the data we already have about our citizens for the betterment of our county - if you decide to give us   a chance.
